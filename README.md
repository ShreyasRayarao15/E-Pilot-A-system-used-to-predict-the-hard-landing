# E-Pilot-A-system-used-to-predict-the-hard-landing
Developed a machine learning system (E-Pilot) to predict hard landings during the approach phase of commercial flights using flight sensor datasets (Pilot, Actuator, Physical).  Implemented and evaluated Logistic Regression and SVM models after feature scaling and dataset integration, achieving accurate early warnings to enhance aviation safety.
